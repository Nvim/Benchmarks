*** config.json file:

- specifies path to the array OR path to an array folder, where every array file will be tested
- specifies a path to a .csv file/folder, where the sorted array(s) will be placed
- specifies wether to run in verbose mode or not 
- specifies project's path

=> need to parse config.json (with python) to retrieve all the correct options to call the c program with.

  * c program will take all these options as arguments
  * c program will make all calculations and output in .csv files
  * python program will read the .csv's and draw plots/print meaningful results to stdout


*** Args for c program:

- sorting method
- array file path
- verbose mode

-> no need to specify an output file, i can just redirect the program's output.
